# WRITE NODE PATH DEBUGGING UPDATE

## Problem Analysis
The render is failing with "You must specify a file name to write to" because the Write2 node in your Nuke script doesn't have a proper output file path set.

## New Approach Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Write Node Validation
- Added comprehensive validation that ensures Write nodes have valid file paths before job submission
- Auto-fix functionality that generates output paths if missing
- Better error messages and user feedback

### 2. New Render Method - Temporary Python Scripts
Instead of using the direct `-X Write2` approach, we now create temporary Python scripts that:
- Open the Nuke script explicitly
- Validate the Write node exists and has a file path
- Execute the Write node with detailed error reporting
- Provide much better debugging output

### 3. Command Change
**OLD COMMAND:**
```
nuke.exe -x script.nk -F frame-frame -X Write2
```

**NEW COMMAND:**
```
nuke.exe -t temp_render_Write2_f1.py
```

Where the temp script contains Python code to safely execute the Write node.

## Next Steps

### 1. Check Write2 Node Configuration
First, let's diagnose what's wrong with your Write2 node:

1. Open your script: `RebuildEnvironment_COMP_v001.nk`
2. In Nuke's Script Editor, run this diagnostic script:

```python
exec(open(r"\\tls-storage02\Install\NUKE\Nuke_PLUG\.nuke_DEV\tractor\check_write2_node.py").read())
```

This will tell us exactly what's wrong with the Write2 node.

### 2. Fix the Write2 Node
Based on the diagnostic output, you'll likely need to:
- Set a proper output file path in the Write2 node
- Make sure the path is absolute (starts with // for network paths)
- Ensure the output directory exists

### 3. Test the New Submission Method
After fixing the Write2 node:
1. Submit a new job using the updated UI
2. Check the Tractor command - it should now use the temporary Python script approach
3. Monitor the render logs for better error reporting

## Expected Improvements

### Better Error Messages
The temporary Python scripts will provide much clearer error messages:
- "Write node 'Write2' not found" if the node doesn't exist
- "Write node 'Write2' has no output file path" if path is missing
- Detailed stack traces for any other issues

### Automatic Path Fixing
If the Write node has no path, the UI will now:
1. Auto-generate a suitable path based on the script name
2. Create the output directory if needed
3. Save the script with the updated path
4. Show clear feedback about what was fixed

### More Reliable Execution
Using Python scripts instead of command-line arguments provides:
- Better error handling
- More detailed logging
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Easier debugging

## Files Updated
- `submit_to_tractor_ui.py` - Enhanced Write node validation and new render method
- `check_write2_node.py` - NEW diagnostic script for troubleshooting Write nodes

## Testing Priority
1. **Diagnose Write2 node** - Run the diagnostic script
2. **Fix Write2 path** - Set proper output file path
3. **Submit test job** - Try the new temporary script method
4. **Check render logs** - Look for improved error messages

The new approach should eliminate the "You must specify a file name to write to" error by ensuring Write nodes always have valid paths before rendering begins.
