# UI Cleanup and Tractor Link Integration

## Changes Made

### 3. Reduced Complexity

## Implementation Details

### Hyperlink Styling
```python
self.tractorLink = QtWidgets.QLabel('<a href="http://10.31.240.8/tv/" style="color: #4A90E2; text-decoration: none; font-size: 13px;">ðŸ”— Open Tractor Web Interface</a>')
self.tractorLink.setOpenExternalLinks(True)
```

### CSS Styling
- Professional blue color scheme (`#4A90E2`)
- Hover effects for visual feedback
- Border and background for clear definition
- Responsive design with proper padding

### Layout Structure
```
Middle Column (Tractor Monitor):
â”œâ”€â”€ Stretch (top spacing)
â”œâ”€â”€ Title Label: "Tractor Job Monitor"
â”œâ”€â”€ Clickable Link: "ðŸ”— Open Tractor Web Interface"  
â”œâ”€â”€ Info Text: Description of functionality
â””â”€â”€ Stretch (bottom spacing)
```

## User Workflow

1. **Job Submission**: User configures and submits jobs as before
2. **Job Monitoring**: Click the Tractor link to open web interface
3. **External Monitoring**: Use full Tractor web UI for:
   - Job status tracking
   - Log file viewing
   - Farm activity monitoring
   - Advanced job management

## Technical Notes

- Link opens in system default browser
- No authentication required (handled by browser)
- Full Tractor web interface functionality available
- Compatible with all operating systems
- No additional network requests from Nuke

The changes result in a cleaner, more reliable UI that leverages the existing Tractor web interface rather than trying to replicate its functionality within the Nuke panel.
