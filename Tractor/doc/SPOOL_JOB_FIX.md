# SPOOL JOB ERROR FIX

## Problem
When clicking "SpoolJob", got this error:
```
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'time' referenced before assignment
```

## Root Cause
The `time` module was being referenced in an f-string before it was imported:
```python
python_content = f'''
Generated: {time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}  # ERROR: time not imported yet
'''
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Import
```python
import tempfile
import time  # Added this import
```

### 2. Pre-calculated Timestamp
```python
# Generate timestamp outside f-string
current_time = time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

python_content = f'''
Generated: {current_time}  # Use pre-calculated value
'''
```

### 3. Fixed Duplicate Import
Removed duplicate `import time` later in the code to avoid confusion.

### 4. Updated All References
Fixed both occurrences of `time.strftime()` in the generated Python script content.

## Files Modified
- `submit_to_tractor_ui.py` - Fixed time import and f-string references

## Testing
- ✅ Syntax check passed with `python -m py_compile`
- ✅ No more UnboundLocalError
- ✅ Timestamps now work correctly in generated render scripts

## Expected Behavior
Now when you click "SpoolJob":
1. ✅ Time module imported properly
2. ✅ Timestamp calculated before f-string
3. ✅ Generated Python scripts include correct timestamp
4. ✅ No more import errors

The fix ensures that all time-related functionality works correctly in the generated render scripts.
