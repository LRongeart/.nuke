# JOB-LEVEL SERVICE AND ENVKEY ENHANCEMENT

## What We've Improved:

### ✅ **Enhanced Job-Level Service Setting**:
```python
# Before: Basic service assignment
if service:
    job.service = service

# After: Robust service validation with fallback
if service:
    job.service = service
    print(f"[DEBUG] Setting job service to: {service}")
else:
    job.service = "NukeXRender"  # Safe fallback
    print(f"[DEBUG] No service selected, using default: NukeXRender")
```

### ✅ **Enhanced Job-Level Envkey Setting**:
```python
# Before: Basic envkey assignment  
if envkey:
    job.envkey = [envkey]
else:
    job.envkey = []

# After: Clear debugging and explanation
if envkey:
    job.envkey = [envkey]
    print(f"[DEBUG] Setting job envkey to: {envkey}")
else:
    job.envkey = []  # Empty for maximum compatibility
    print(f"[DEBUG] Using empty envkey for maximum blade compatibility")
```

### ✅ **Service Validation**:
- Validates custom service names are entered
- Ensures service is always set (fallback to NukeXRender)
- Clear error messages for missing services

### ✅ **Advanced Blade Matching Analysis**:
After job submission, automatically:
1. **Queries all available blades**
2. **Compares job requirements vs blade capabilities**
3. **Reports exact matches** for service, envkey, and crews  
4. **Identifies compatible blades** or explains why none match
5. **Provides actionable feedback** for troubleshooting

## Current Job Structure:
```tcl
Job -service {NukeXRender} -envkey {} -crews {{3D4}} -maxactive 10 -subtasks {
  Task {Render Write1} -id {id0001} -refersto {id0001} -subtasks {
    Task {Frame 1} -id {id0001} -refersto {id0001}
  }
}
```

## Debug Output Now Shows:
- ✅ **Job-level attributes** (service, envkey, crews)
- ✅ **Blade compatibility analysis** 
- ✅ **Exact matching results** per blade
- ✅ **Clear success/failure indicators**

This should give you complete visibility into why jobs are or aren't being picked up by blades!
